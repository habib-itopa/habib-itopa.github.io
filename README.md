- Reviewed over 100 security vulnerabilities in OpenEMR software applications, providing solutions to patch weaknesses and improve software reliability.
- Developed and implemented benchmarking methodologies for smart contracts in decentralized marketplaces, focusing on scalability and security improvements.

**Machine Learning Engineer Intern @ Interglobal Limited, Abuja, NG (_January 2018 - July 2018_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the impact of over 300 biometrics variables on human performance in hyper-realistic, live-fire training scenarios
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes

## Course Project Experience
### Automated Learning and Data Analysis (Python)
- Developed machine learning models to predict rainfall patterns using a 50-year precipitation dataset, achieving improved accuracy through cross-validation techniques.
- Applied neural networks and regression models, optimizing parameters to minimize mean squared error.
  
### Software Security
- Conducted security testing for OpenEMR using white box, black box, and fuzz testing techniques.
- Identified vulnerabilities, assessed risks, and developed mitigation strategies, improving software security protocols.
